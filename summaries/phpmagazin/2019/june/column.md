PHP exists since 1995, but object-oriented programming is only possible since about 2005 with [PHP4](https://www.php.net/manual/php4.php).
Initially the PHP Extension and Application Repository [PEAR](https://pear.php.net/) was used to provide several libraries.
Gradually the development of several huge frameworks began.
[Zend](https://framework.zend.com/), [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org/), [Agavi](https://github.com/agavi/agavi) and [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) have been born.
With the high diversity of frameworks, a certain controversy arose about "Which framework is the best".
When at a conference the core developers of each framework were brought together for a discussion round, one hoped for a "dispute". Even nerf weapons were added to each seat.
But in the end they treated each other very respectfully and praised each other.
There is still no answer to the question "Which framework is the best". There will never be an answer. 
However, there is a tendency to move away from large, full-stack frameworks towards micro frameworks like [Slim](http://www.slimframework.com/).
